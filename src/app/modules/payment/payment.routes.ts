/*

When booking starts, a transaction rollback will also start, because two collections are being updated one after another.

1. Create a new booking document.
2. Create a new payment document and update the booking document.
3. Create the sslPayload.
4. Call sslService.sslPaymentInit(sslPayload).
5. Inside sslPaymentInit(), the user is redirected to the SSLCommerz payment page:

If success: SSLCommerz will hit SSL_SUCCESS_BACKEND_URL, which reaches the backend and then redirects to the frontend SSL_SUCCESS_FRONTEND_URL.

If failed: SSLCommerz will hit SSL_FAIL_BACKEND_URL, then redirect to the frontend SSL_FAIL_FRONTEND_URL.

If cancelled: SSLCommerz will hit SSL_CANCEL_BACKEND_URL, then redirect to the frontend SSL_CANCEL_FRONTEND_URL.

+++++
ssl will call /validate-payment and call validatePayment in the ssl service
we will get paymentGatewayData in ssl service validatePatment

Note:
If the user wants to repay, take the bookingId from the URL params and start again from Step 3.
